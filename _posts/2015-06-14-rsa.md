# what is RSA?
[RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) is a *public-key*, or *asymmetric*, encryption algorithm.
In contrast to *symmetric* algorithms, like [DES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard) and
[AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), which use the same key for both encryption and
decryption, RSA employs two distinct keys: a **public** key used to encrypt data, and a **private key** used to
decrypt whatever was encrypted with the public one. The beauty of public-key encryption is that the parties involved
never need to exchange a master key, meaning that communications can be securely encrypted without any prior contact.

Public-key encryption was proposed by [Whitfield Diffie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie) and [Martin
Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hellman) in '76, while RSA itself was patented in '77 by [Ron
**R**ivest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest), [Adi **S**hamir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir), and
[Leonard **A**dleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Adleman), who then went on to found a
cybersecurity [company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Security) of the same name -- confusing, but great PR!

![Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman]({% static rivest_shamir_adleman.png %})

[Clifford Cocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Cocks), an English cryptographer, arrived at a similar
algorithm in '73 while working for British intelligence at
[GHCQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters), but his work wasn't declassified until
1998 due to its sensitivity. Forty years later, RSA underpins SSL certification, SSH handshakes, and lots more.

In this post, we'll implement RSA, but we'll very much take the long way around while doing so. The algorithm
introduces a number of interesting problems, like finding greatest common divisors, performing modular exponentiation,
computing modular inverses, and generating random prime numbers, each of which we'll thoroughly explore and derive
solutions to (many of these won't be immediately clear, so we'll formally prove them as we go). Note that we won't
prove RSA itself -- I might add that as an extension to the article at some point in the future.

# math precursor
$$
\def \imod {\text{ mod }}
\def \divs {\text{ } \vert \text{ }}
$$ The only thing we need to know before diving into RSA is some [modular
arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic), which is simply arithmetic with the property that
numbers have a maximum value (called the *modulus*) and wrap around to 0 when they exceed it. When we take a number
$$a \imod b$$, we're basically taking the remainder of $$\frac{a}{b}$$; most programming languages provide this in the
form of a `mod` function or `%` operator. We'll see lots of expressions in the form of:

$$a \equiv b \pmod c$$

Here, the $$\equiv$$ symbol implies *congruence*, or that $$a \text{ mod } c$$ equals $$b \text{ mod } c$$. An
important gotcha is that $$\pmod c$$ applies to *both* sides of the expression, which isn't immediately obvious to
anyone used to the modulo operator in the programming sense. Many sources choose to omit the parentheses, simply
writing $$a \equiv b \imod c$$, which just compounds the confusion; the clearest notation would probably be something
like $$(a \equiv b) \pmod c$$. This is extremely important to remember because otherwise, expressions like $$a \equiv 1
\imod b$$ won't make any sense at all ("but if $$1 \imod b$$ is equal to 1 for all $$b$$ not equal to 1, why not just
write $$a = 1$$?!").

Some notes about miscellaneous notation:

  1. $$a \divs b$$ means that $$a$$ divides, or is a factor of, $$b$$
  2. range notation is used here and there: $$[a, b]$$ represents all of the numbers between $$a$$ and $$b$$ inclusive,
     $$[a, b)$$ includes $$a$$ but excludes $$b$$, $$(a, b)$$ excludes both $$a$$ *and* $$b$$, etc.

# how RSA works
RSA revolves around a numeric key-pair, or a mathematically related public and private key. The public key is made
known to the world, which can then use it to encrypt a message, while the private key can be used to decrypt anything
encrypted with the public key. Encrypting and decrypting a message is fairly straightforward, while generating a
key-pair is a more substantial process.

# generate a key-pair
To generate a public/private key-pair:

  1. generate two (large) random primes, $$p$$ and $$q$$
  2. let $$n = pq$$
  3. find $$\phi(n)$$ ([Euler's totient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_totient_function)), or the number of
     integers in the range $$[1, n]$$ that are coprime with $$n$$ -- that is, have a Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 1
     with it.
  4. find a value $$e$$ such that $$1 \lt e \lt \phi(n)$$ and $$e$$ is coprime with $$\phi(n)$$; this is your **public
     key**.
  5. find a value $$d$$ such that $$de \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$$ -- in other words, find the [multiplicative modular
     inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of $$e$$ modulo $$\phi(n)$$; this is your
     **private key**.

Though short and concise, the above steps present several complex problems:

  1. generate a large, random prime number; this is probably the most involved, so we'll save it for last (**step 1**)
  2. find $$\phi(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the product of two primes (**step 3**)
  3. find the GCD of two numbers, which will allow us to find $$e$$ (**step 4**)
  4. find the multiplicative modular inverse of a value, to find $$d$$ (**step 4**)

## example
Before we dive into solving those, let's walk through the process of generating a key-pair using some small sample
numbers.

  1. let $p = 3$ and $q = 5$
  2. $n = 3 \cdot 5 = 15$
  3. $\phi(15) = 8$ (coprime values are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14)
  4. $e = 3$, because 3 is both less than and coprime with 8
  5. $d = 3$, because $$3 \cdot 3 = 9$$ and $$9 \equiv 1 \pmod 8$$

Easy! Except, of course, we weren't dealing with numbers with hundreds of digits -- that's the hard part. :)

## finding $$\phi(n)$$
To compute $$\phi(n)$$, we can take advantage of the fact that it's composed of two **prime** factors: $$p$$ and $$q$$.
Thus, the only values with which it shares GCDs that aren't 1 must be multiples of either $$p$$ or $$q$$ (for instance,
$$\gcd(n, 2q) = q$$ and $$\gcd(n, 3p) = p$$). There are only $$q$$ multiples of $$p$$ ($$p, 2p, 3p, \ldots, qp$$) and
$$p$$ multiples of $$q$$ ($$q, 2q, 3q, \ldots, qp$$) that are less than or equal to $$n$$. Thus, there are $$q + p$$
values in the range $$[1, n]$$ that have a GCD with $$n$$ not equal to 1. Note, however, that we double counted $$pq$$
in our list of multiples of $$p$$ and $$q$$, so in reality it's $$p + q - 1$$. Thus, $$\phi(n) = \text{total} - (p + q
-1)$$, where $$\text{total}$$ is the total numbers of values in the range $$[1, n]$$ -- that is, $$n$$.

$$\phi(n) = n - (p + q - 1) = n - p - q + 1$$

## computing GCDs
To find the GCD of two numbers, we'll employ the [Euclidean
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Euclidean_algorithm):

  1. the GCD of any number and 0 is the absolute value of that number
  2. the GCD of numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ is the GCD of $$b$$ and $$(a \text{ mod } b)$$

or:

{% highlight python table %}
def gcd(a, b):
    return abs(a) if b == 0 else gcd(b, a % b)
{% endhighlight %}

Let's prove it. Case 1 should be self-explanatory: 0 is technically divisible by any number, even if the quotient
equals 0, so the GCD of 0 and any other number should be that number. We need to be careful and take its absolute
value, however, to account for negative values; the greatest divisor of -5 is 5, after all, not -5, so the
GCD of 0 and -5 must also be 5. Thus, we have to take the absolute value of -5 to arrive at the greatest divisor.

Case 2 is less intuitive (at least for me), and requires proving that $$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a \imod b)$$. Let's begin
by creating another variable $$c$$:

$$
c = a - b
$$

### prove $$\gcd(a, b) \divs c$$
We first want to prove that the GCD of $$a$$ and $$b$$ divides $$c$$ (or $$\gcd(a, b) \divs c$$). Begin by rewriting
$$a$$ and $$b$$ as products of their GCD.

$$
a = x \cdot \gcd(a, b)\\
b = y \cdot \gcd(a, b)\\
$$

$$x$$ and $$y$$ are just placeholders: we don't want to know or care what they equal. Now, plug those into the
definition of $$c$$:

$$
c = a - b\\
c = x \cdot \gcd(a, b) - y \cdot \gcd(a, b) = (x - y) \gcd(a, b)\\
\therefore \gcd(a, b) \divs c
$$

Since we've shown that $$c$$ is the product of $$\gcd(a, b)$$ and another value, it is by definition divisible by
$$\gcd(a, b)$$.

### prove $$\gcd(b, c) \divs a$$
Apply the same logic here:

$$
b = x \cdot \gcd(b, c)\\
c = y \cdot \gcd(b, c)\\
a = c + b\\
a = x \cdot \gcd(b, c) + y \cdot \gcd(b, c) = (x + y) \gcd(b, c)\\
\therefore \gcd(b, c) \divs a
$$

### prove $$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - b)$$
We know that, by definition, $$\gcd(a, b) \divs b$$, and we've proven that $$\gcd(a, b) \divs c$$. Thus, $$\gcd(a, b)$$
is a *common divisor* of both $$b$$ and $$c$$. That doesn't imply that it's the least common divisor, greatest, or
anything else: all we know is that it divides both numbers. We *do* know that there exists a **greatest** common
divisor of $$b$$ and $$c$$, $$\gcd(b, c)$$, so we can conclude that:

$$\gcd(a, b) \le \gcd(b, c)$$

We now re-apply that same reasoning. We know that $$\gcd(b, c) \divs b$$ and $$\gcd(b, c) \divs a$$. Thus, $$\gcd(b,
c)$$ is a common divisor of $$b$$ and $$a$$. Since we know that the **greatest** common divisor of $$a$$ and $$b$$ is
$$\gcd(a, b)$$, we can conclude that:

$$\gcd(b, c) \le \gcd(a, b)$$

But now we have two almost contradictory conclusions:

$$
\gcd(a, b) \le \gcd(b, c)\\
\gcd(b, c) \le \gcd(a, b)
$$

The only way these can both be true is if:

$$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, c)$$

So we've proven that $$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - b)$$ (remember, $$c = a - b$$).

### prove $$\gcd(b, a - b) = \gcd(b, a \imod b)$$
First, let's assume that $$a > b$$, and rewrite it as: $$a = bq + r$$ (or $$r = a \imod b$$)

Now, we already know that $$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - b)$$, Since order doesn't matter, we can rewrite $$\gcd(b, a -
b)$$ as $$\gcd(a - b, b)$$. Now, we apply the rule $$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - b)$$ again.

$$
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - b) = \gcd(a - b, b)\\
\gcd(a - b, b) = \gcd(b, a - b - b) = \gcd(a - 2b, b)\\
\gcd(a - 2b, b) = \gcd(b, a - 2b - b) = \gcd(a - 3b, b)\\
\gcd(a - 3b, b) = \gcd(b, a - 3b - b) = \gcd(a - 4b, b)\\
\ldots\\
\gcd(a - qb, b) = \gcd(r, b)
$$

or:

$$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(a - b, b) = \gcd(a - 2b, b) = \ldots = \gcd(a - qb, b) = \gcd(r, b)$$

Bingo. We've proven Case 2, and completed our proof of the Euclidean Algorithm. Before we move on, we'll also define a
convenience wrapper for `gcd()` that determines whether two numbers are prime:

{% highlight python table %}
def coprime(a, b):
    return gcd(a, b) == 1
{% endhighlight %}


## finding modular inverses
Given a value $$a$$ and modulus $$c$$, the modular multiplicative inverse of $$a$$ is a value $$b$$ that satisfies:

$$ab \equiv 1 \pmod c$$

This implies that there exists some value $$d$$ for which:

$$
ab = 1 + cd\\
ab - cd = 1
$$

This turns out to be in the form of [Bézout's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout's_identity), which
states that for values $$m$$ and $$n$$, there exist values $$x$$ and $$y$$ that satisfy:

$$
mx + ny = \gcd(m, n)
$$

$$x$$ and $$y$$, called Bézout coefficients, can be solved for using the [Extended Euclidean
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) (EEA). $$x$$ corresponds to $$b$$, or the
modular inverse that we were looking for, while $$y$$ can be thrown out once computed. The EEA will also give us the
GCD of $$m$$ and $$n$$ -- it is, after all, an extension of the Euclidean algorithm, which we use to find the GCD of
two values. We need to verify that it equals 1, since we make the assume that $$\gcd(m, n) = 1$$; if it doesn't, $$a$$
has no modular inverse. Since `modular_inverse()` is just a wrapper for EEA -- to be implemented in a function called
`bezout_coefficients()` -- its definition is simple:

{% highlight python table %}
def modular_inverse(num, modulus):
    coef1, _, gcd = bezout_coefficients(num, modulus)
    return coef1 if gcd == 1 else None
{% endhighlight %}

`bezout_coefficients()` is a bit tricker:

{% highlight python table %}
def bezout_coefficients(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return -1 if a < 0 else 1, 0, abs(a)
    else:
        quotient, remainder = divmod(a, b)
        coef1, coef2, gcd = bezout_coefficients(b, remainder)
        return coef2, coef1 - quotient * coef2, gcd
{% endhighlight %}

Let's see why it works.

### the Extended Euclidean algorithm
How to solve for $$x$$ and $$y$$? Bezout's Identity states:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = ax + by\\
$$

or, for $$\gcd(b, a \imod b)$$:

$$
\gcd(b, a \imod b) = bx' + (a \imod b)y'\\
$$

Let's simplify:

$$a \imod b = a - \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor b$$

Here, $$\lfloor \rfloor$$ represents the *floor* function, which floors the result of $$\frac{a}{b}$$ to an integer.

$$
\gcd(b, a \imod b) = bx' + (a - \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor b)y' =\\
  bx' + ay' - \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor by' =\\
  ay' + b(x' - \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor y')
$$

Since we know, by the already proven Euclidean algorithm, that $$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a \imod b)$$, we can write:

$$
ax + by = ay' + b(x' - \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor y')
$$

So, $$x = y'$$ and $$y = x' - \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor y'$$. But what are $$x'$$ and $$y'$$? They're the results of
running the EEA on $$(b, a \imod b)$$! Classic recursion. In sum:

{% highlight python table %}
def bezout_coefficients(a, b):
    quotient, remainder = divmod(a, b)
    coef1, coef2 = bezout_coefficients(b, remainder)
    return coef2, coef1 - quotient * coef2
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, we need a base case, or we'll end up recursing *ad infinitum*. Let's take the case of $$b = 0$$.

$$
ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\\
b = 0\\
ax + 0y = \gcd(a, 0)\\
ax = |a|\\
x = \frac{|a|}{a}
$$

So, if $$b = 0$$, we set the $$x$$ coefficient to 1 if $$a$$ is positive and -1 is $$a$$ is negative, and set $$y$$
to... what? If $$b$$ is 0, then $$y$$ can take on any value. For simplicity's sake we'll choose 0. Our revised
definition looks like:

{% highlight python table %}
def bezout_coefficients(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return -1 if a < 0 else 1, 0
    else:
        quotient, remainder = divmod(a, b)
        coef1, coef2 = bezout_coefficients(b, remainder)
        return coef2, coef1 - quotient * coef2
{% endhighlight %}

Also note that, since this is simply a more involved version of the Euclidean algorithm (we're making recursive calls
to `bezout_coefficients(b, remainder)` and have a base case of `b == 0`), when we hit the base case, `abs(a)` is the
GCD of `a` and `b`. Since `modular_inverse()` needs to check that the GCD of its two arguments equals 1, we should
return it in addition to the coefficients themselves. Hence, we'll let it trickle up from our base case into the final
return value:

{% highlight python table %}
def bezout_coefficients(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return -1 if a < 0 else 1, 0, abs(a)
    else:
        quotient, remainder = divmod(a, b)
        coef1, coef2, gcd = bezout_coefficients(b, remainder)
        return coef2, coef1 - quotient * coef2, gcd
{% endhighlight %}

## generating large, random primes
Here's the idea:

  1. generate a large, random, **odd** number $$x$$
  2. check $$x$$ for primality
     1. if $$x$$ prime, return it
     2. otherwise, increment $$x$$ by 2, and return to step **2.)**

Easy enough, except for the bit about testing primality. How to do so efficiently? We'll turn to the
[Rabin-Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test) algorithm, a probabilistic primality
test which either tells us with absolute certainty that a number is composite, or with high likelihood that it's prime.
We're fine with a merely probabilistic solution because it's *fast*, since speed is a non-negligible issue due to the
size of the numbers that we're dealing with, and also because the chances of a false positive (ie indicating that a
number is prime when it's actually composite) are astronomically low after even only a few iterations of the test.

### Rabin-Miller primality test
The Rabin-Miller test relies on the below two assumptions (just accept that they're true for now, and we'll prove them
later on). If $$p$$ is a prime number:

  1. $$a ^ {p - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$$ for any $$a$$ not divisible by $$p$$
  2. for any $$x$$ that satisfies $$x ^ 2 \equiv 1 \pmod p$$, $$x$$ **must** equal ±1

Using these, you can test a value $$n$$ for compositeness like so (note that we return `true`/`false` to indicate
definite compositeness/probable primality respectively):

  1. pick a random value $$a$$ in the range $$[2, n - 1]$$
  2. use **assumption 1** to assert that $$a ^ {n - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod n$$); if it's not, return `true`
  3. if $$a$$ has an integer square root, let $$a' = \sqrt a$$; otherwise, return `false`
  4. since $$a' ^ 2 \equiv 1 \pmod n$$, we can use **assumption 2** to assert that $$a' \equiv \pm 1 \pmod n$$; if not,
     return `true`
  5. otherwise, repeat steps 3-4, taking the square root of $$a'$$, and the square root of that, and so on, until you
     hit a value that doesn't have an integer square root.
  6. if you haven't already returned anything, you've satisfied assumptions **1** and **2** for all testable cases and
     can return `false`.

In sum, we return `true` if we've confirmed that $$a$$ is a *witness to the compositeness* of $$n$$, and `false` if
$$a$$ does *not* prove that $$n$$ is composite -- transitively, there is a high chance that $$n$$ is prime, but we can
only be more sure by running more such tests. While the above steps serve as a good verbal description of the
algorithm, we'll have to slightly modify them to convert the algorithm into real code.

We need to implement a function `is_witness()`, which checks whether a random value is a witness to the compositeness
of our prime candidate, $$n$$.

  1. write $$n - 1$$ in the form $$2 ^ s d$$. $$n=73$$, for instance, would yield $$s=3$$ and $$d=9$$, since $$73 - 1 =
     72 = 2 ^ 3 \cdot 9$$.
  2. pick a random value $$a$$ in the range $$[2, n - 1]$$. We'll check whether this is a witness for $$n$$.
  3. let $$x = a ^ d \imod n$$
  4. if $$x \equiv \pm 1 \pmod n$$, then return `false`
  5. repeat $$s - 1$$ times:
     1. let $$x = x ^ 2 \imod n$$
     2. if $$x = 1$$, return `true`
     3. if $$x = n - 1$$, return `false`
  6. if we haven't returned yet, return `true`

These steps seem quite a bit different from before, but in reality, they're exactly the same and just operating in
reverse. We start with a value that doesn't have an integer square root, and square it until we hit $$a ^ {n - 1}$$.
Why did we bother decomposing $$n - 1$$ into the form of $$2 ^ s d$$? Well, it allows us to rewrite $$a ^ {n - 1}$$
as $$a ^ {2 ^ s d}$$, and now we know **exactly** how many times we can take square roots before we hit a value that
isn't reducible any further -- in this case, $$a ^ d$$.

$$
a_1 = \sqrt{a ^ {2 ^ s d}} = (a ^ {2 ^ s d}) ^ \frac{1}{2} = a ^ {\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 2 ^ {s - 1} d} =
  a ^ {2 ^ {s - 1} d}\\
a_2 = \sqrt{a ^ {2 ^ {s - 1} d}} = (a ^ {2 ^ {s - 1} d}) ^ \frac{1}{2} = a ^ {\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 2 ^ {s - 2} d}
  = a ^ {2 ^ {s - 2} d}\\
\ldots\\
a_{last} = a ^ d
$$

So, if we start with $$a ^ d$$ and square it, we'll get $$a ^ {2d}$$, then $$a ^ {2 ^ 2 d}$$, then $$a ^ {2 ^ 3 d}$$,
and ultimately $$a ^ {2 ^ s d}$$, or $$a ^ {n - 1}$$. What's the advantage of starting from the non-reducible value and
squaring it, rather than the reducible value and taking its square roots? It sometimes allows us to short-circuit the
process. For instance, as we iterate through the squares of $$a ^ d$$, if we find an occurrence of -1, we know that
we'll get 1 when we square it, and 1 when we square that, and keep on getting 1s until we stop iterating. As a
consequence, we know that we won't find any failing conditions, and can exit early by returning `false` (**step 5.3**).
The same goes for **step 4**: if $$a ^ d \equiv \pm 1 \pmod n$$, we know that each of the following squares will equal
1, so we immediately return `false`.

The failing conditions -- ie those that cause the algorithm to return `true` -- might not be immediately clear. In
**5.2**, we know that, if $$x = 1$$, we've violated **assumption 2**, because that implies that the previous value of
$$x$$ was not equivalent to $$\pm 1 \pmod n$$. Wait, why? Because if it were equal to -1, we would've already returned
via **5.3** in the previous iteration, and if it were $$1$$, then we would've returned either from **5.3** in an
earlier iteration still or **4** at the very beginning. We also return `true` when we hit **6**, because we know that
by that point, if **assumption 1** is:

  1. true, and $$x = a ^ {n - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod n$$, then the previous value of $$x$$ can't be either 1 or -1 because
     we would already have returned via either **4** or **5.3**.
  2. false, then by definition $$n$$ can't be prime, since the assumption *must* hold true for prime $$n$$

Finally, we simply repeat the `is_witness()` test $$k = 5$$ times. Here's the final implementation:

{% highlight python table %}
def is_prime(n, k=5):
    if n == 2:
        return True

    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False

    s, d = decompose_to_factors_of_2(n - 1)

    def is_witness(a):
        x = modular_power(a, d, n)
        if x in [1, n - 1]:
            return False

        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = modular_power(x, 2, n)
            if x == 1:
                return True

            if x == n - 1:
                return False

        return True

    for _ in range(k):
        if is_witness(random.randint(2, n - 1)):
            return False

    return True

def decompose_to_factors_of_2(num):
    s = 0
    d = num

    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1

    return s, d
{% endhighlight %}

Note that we've introduced a currently undefined function, `modular_power()`. The problem with computing $$a ^ d \imod
n$$ and $$x ^ 2 \imod n$$ is that $$a$$, $$d$$, $$x$$, and $$n$$ are **HUGE**. Simply running `(a ** d) % n` would be
asking for trouble. Fortunately, there are efficient ways of performing modular exponentiation, and we'll implement
one such method in the `modular_power()` function later in this article. Now, we need to actually prove the two
assumptions that we base Rabin-Miller on.

#### Euclid's lemma
...but before we do so, we need to prove [Euclid's Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid's_lemma), since both of
the following proofs depend on it. It states that if $$p$$ is relatively prime to $$a$$ and $$p \divs ab$$, then $$p
\divs b$$. We'll prove it using Bezout's Identity. The GCD of $$a$$ and $$p$$ is 1, so there must exist $$x$$ and $$y$$
that satisfy:

$$ax + py = 1$$

Multiply both sides by $$b$$:

$$abx + pby = b$$

$$abx$$ is divisible by $$p$$ (because it's divisible by $$ab$$, which is divisible by $$p$$ according to the lemma's
requisite), and $$pby$$ is by definition divisible by $$p$$, so $$b$$ must be divisible by $$p$$ too.

#### proof of assumption 1
Our first assumption was that for a prime $$p$$, $$a ^ {p - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$$ for any $$a$$ **not divisible by
$$p$$**. This is better known as [Fermat's Little Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_little_theorem). To
prove it, begin by multiplying all of the numbers in the range $$[1, p)$$ by $$a$$:

$$a, 2a, 3a, \ldots, (p - 1) a$$

We make two observations:

  1. given two values $$x$$ and $$y$$, $$ax \equiv ay \pmod p$$ is equivalent to $$x \equiv y \pmod p$$ (we effectively
     divide out $$a$$). We can prove this by rewriting $$ax \equiv ay \pmod p$$ as $$ax - ay \equiv 0 \pmod p$$, which
     implies that $$p \divs ax - ay$$, or $$p \divs a(x - y)$$. By Euclid's Lemma, since $$p$$ and $$a$$ are coprime
     (reminder: this is a criterion of Fermat's Little Theorem), $$p \divs x - y$$, which means we can write $$x - y
     \equiv 0 \pmod p$$, or $$x \equiv y \pmod p$$.

  2. when each of its elements is simplified in $$\imod p$$, the above sequence is simply a rearrangement of $$1, 2,
     \ldots, p - 1$$. This is true because, firstly, its values all lie in the range $$[1, p)$$ -- none can equal 0
     since $$p$$ shares no factors other than 1 with either $$a$$ or any value in $$1, 2, \ldots, p - 1$$ due to its
     primeness. The trick now is to realize that, if we have two distinct values $$x$$ and $$y$$, and know that $$ax
     \equiv ay \pmod p$$, then by the previous observation we can "divide out $$a$$" and have $$x \equiv y \pmod p$$.
     If $$x$$ and $$y$$ were two values chosen from the $$1, \ldots, p - 1$$ sequence, we'd know that they're all less
     than $$p$$, and can thus remove the $$\imod p$$ from the expression, leaving us with: $$x = y$$. In conclusion,
     the only way to satisfy $$ax \equiv ay \imod p$$ is to have $$x$$ be the same item as $$y$$, and that means that
     the distinct values in $$a, \ldots, (p - 1) a$$ map to distinct values in $$1, \ldots, p - 1$$.

By **observation 1**:

$$
a \cdot 2a \cdot \ldots \cdot (p - 1) a \equiv 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p - 1) \pmod p\\
a ^ {p - 1} (p - 1)! \equiv (p - 1)! \pmod p
$$

By **observation 2**, we can cancel out each of the factors of $$(p - 1)!$$ from both sides of the expressions (after
all, $$p$$ is prime and all of the factors of $$(p - 1)!$$ are less than it, so it's coprime with all of them), which
leaves us with:

$$a ^ {p - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$$

QED.

#### proof of assumption 2
We now prove assumption 2: if $$p$$ is prime and $$x ^ 2 \equiv 1 \pmod p$$, $$x$$ must equal $$\pm 1 \imod p$$. First,
for greater clarity later on, we can rewrite our conclusion as: $$p$$ must divide either $$x - 1$$ or $$x + 1$$. Now,
if $$x ^ 2 \equiv 1 \pmod p$$, then:

$$
x ^ 2 - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod p\\
p \divs x ^ 2 - 1\\
p \divs (x - 1)(x + 1)
$$

If $$p$$ divides $$x - 1$$, then:

$$
x - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod p\\
x \equiv 1 \pmod p
$$

and we've proven our conclusion. What if $$p$$ *doesn't* divide $$x - 1$$? We can then leverage Euclid's Lemma: if
$$p$$ is relatively prime to $$a$$ and $$p \divs ab$$, then $$p \divs b$$. We know that $$p$$ is prime and doesn't
divide $$x - 1$$, so it's relatively prime to $$x - 1$$, and we know that it divides $$(x - 1)(x + 1)$$. As a result,
it has to divide $$x + 1$$, which implies that: $$x \equiv -1 \pmod p$$. Again, we've proven our conclusion, and thus
proven assumption 2.

### applying Rabin-Miller
Now that we've implemented Rabin-Miller, creating a large, random prime is almost trivial:

{% highlight python table %}
def get_random_prime(num_bits):
    lower_bound = 2 ** (num_bits - 2)
    upper_bound = 2 ** (num_bits - 1) - 1
    guess = random.randint(lower_bound, upper_bound)

    if guess % 2 == 0:
        guess += 1

    while not is_prime(guess):
        guess += 2

    return guess
{% endhighlight %}

The `num_bits` parameter is a bit of a weird way of specifying the desired size of the prime, but it'll make sense
since we usually want to create RSA keys of a specific bit-length (more on this later on).

## wrapping it all up
At long last, we can define our `create_key_pair()` function.

{% highlight python table %}
def create_key_pair(bit_length):
    prime_bit_length = bit_length // 2
    p = get_random_prime(prime_bit_length)
    q = get_random_prime(prime_bit_length)
    n = p * q
    totient = (p - 1) * (q - 1)

    while True:
        e_candidate = random.randint(3, totient - 1)
        if e_candidate % 2 == 0:
            e_candidate += 1

        if coprime(e_candidate, totient):
            e = e_candidate
            break

    d = modular_inverse(e, totient)
    return e, d, n
{% endhighlight %}

The only thing that requires explanation is this `bit_length` business. The idea here is that we generally want to
create RSA keys of a certain bit-length (1024 and 2048 are common values), so we pass in a parameter specifying the
length. To make sure that $$n$$ has a bit-length approximately equal to `bit_length`, we need to make sure that the
primes $$p$$ and $$q$$ that we use to create it have a bit length of `bit_length / 2`, since multiplying two $$n$$-bit
numbers yields an approximately $$2n$$-bit value. How come? The number of bits in a positive integer $$n$$ is
$$\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor + 1$$, so the number of bits in $$n ^ 2$$ is $$\lfloor \log_2 n ^ 2\rfloor + 1$$. According
to the [logarithm power rule](http://www.rapidtables.com/math/algebra/logarithm/Logarithm_Rules.htm#power rule), we can
rewrite $$\log{a ^ b}$$ as $$b \cdot \log a$$, so the bit length equals $$\lfloor 2\log_2 n \rfloor + 1$$. In other
words, $$n ^ 2$$ has roughly twice as many bits as $$n$$.

# encrypt/decrypt messages
In comparison to generating keys, encrypting and decrypting data with them is mercifully simple.

  1. encrypt a message $$m$$ with public key $$e$$ and modulus $$n$$: $$m ^ e \imod n$$
  2. decrypt a message $$c$$ with private key $$d$$ and modulus $$n$$: $$c ^ d \imod n$$

{% highlight python table %}
def encrypt(e, n, m):
    return modular_power(m, e, n)

def decrypt(d, n, c):
    return modular_power(c, d, n)
{% endhighlight %}

So, what's `modular_power()`? The problem with the encryption and decryption operations, which look
deceptively trivial, is that all of the values involved are big. Really, really big. As a result, naively solving $$a ^
b \imod c$$ by simply resolving $$a ^ b$$ and then simplifying that modulo $$c$$ is a no-go. Fortunately, there are
more efficient ways of performing [modular exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation), like
exponentiation by squaring.

## exponentiation by squaring
When trying to solve $$a ^ b \imod c$$, begin by representing $$b$$ in binary form:

$$b = 2 ^ {n - 1} bit_{n - 1} + 2 ^ {n - 2} bit_{n - 2} + \ldots + 2 bit_1 + bit_0$$

where $$n$$ is the total number of bits in $$b$$, and $$bit$$ represents the value of each bit -- either 0 or 1. Now,
rewrite the original expression:

$$
a ^ b \imod c =\\
a ^ {2 ^ {n - 1} bit_{n - 1} + 2 ^ {n - 2} bit_{n - 2} + \ldots + 2 bit_1 + bit_0} \imod c =\\
a ^ {2 ^ {n - 1} bit_{n - 1}} \cdot a ^ { 2 ^ {n - 2} bit_{n - 2}} \cdot \ldots \cdot a ^ {2 bit_1} \cdot a ^ {bit_0}
  \imod c\\
$$

For illustrative purposes, let's temporarily remove the $$bit$$ factor from each exponent, which leaves us with:

$$a ^ {2 ^ {n - 1}} \cdot a ^ { 2 ^ {n - 2}} \cdot \ldots \cdot a ^ {2} \cdot a \imod c$$

It's now obvious that each factor is a square of the one that precedes it: $$a ^ {2}$$ is the square of $$a$$,
$$a ^ {2 ^ {n - 1}}$$ is the square of $$a ^ { 2 ^ {n - 2}}$$, etc. If we were to programmatically solve the
expression, we could maintain a variable, say `accumulator`, that we'd initialize to $$a$$, and square from
factor to factor to avoid recomputing $$a ^ {\text{big exponent}}$$ every time. Now, let's reintroduce $$bit$$:

$$
a ^ {2 ^ {n - 1} bit_{n - 1}} \cdot a ^ { 2 ^ {n - 2} bit_{n - 2}} \cdot \ldots \cdot a ^ {2 bit_1} \cdot a ^ {bit_0}
  \imod c\\
$$

The good thing is that $$bit$$ has a limited set of possible values: just 0 and 1! Any value in the form
$$a ^ {2 ^ p bit}$$ -- that is, all of the above factors -- evaluates to $$a ^ {2 ^ p}$$ when $$bit = 1$$,
and $$a ^ 0$$, or 1, when $$bit = 0$$. In other words, the value of $$bit$$ only controls whether or not we multiply
one of the factors into the accumulator that'll become our ultimate result (since if $$bit = 0$$, we'll just end up
multiplying in 1, which means we shouldn't even bother). Thus, `modular_power()` might look something like this:

{% highlight python table %}
def modular_power(base, exp, modulus):
    result = 1

    while exp:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = result * base
        exp >>= 1
        base = base ** 2

    return result % modulus
{% endhighlight %}

But we still haven't addressed the issue of multiplying huge numbers by huge numbers, and this version of
`modular_power()` doesn't perform much better than `(base ** exp) % modulus` (in fact, after some spot checking, it
appears to be much slower!). We can address that by taking advantage of the following property of modular
multiplication:

$$xy \imod z = (x \imod z)(y \imod z) \imod z$$

We can prove it by rewriting $$x$$ and $$y$$ in terms of $$z$$:

$$
x = q_x z + r_x\\
y = q_y z + r_y
$$

and substituting that into the original expression:

$$
xy \imod z =\\
(q_x z + r_x) (q_y z + r_y) \imod z =\\
q_x q_y z ^ 2 + q_x z r_y + r_x q_y z + r_x r_y \imod z =\\
z(q_x q_y z + q_x r_y + r_x q_y) + r_x r_y \imod z =\\
r_x r_y \imod z
$$

We're able to remove the entire chunk of the expression that gets multiplied by $$z$$ because it's by definition
divisible by $$z$$, meaning that, taken $$\imod z$$, it would equal 0, and wouldn't contribute anything to the sum.
Thus, $$xy \imod z$$ equals $$r_x r_y \imod z$$, or $$(x \imod z)(y \imod z) \imod z$$.

Using that, we can make the following adjustment to our initial implementation:

{% highlight python table %}
def modular_power(base, exp, modulus):
    result = 1
    base %= modulus

    while exp:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        exp >>= 1
        base = (base ** 2) % modulus

    return result
{% endhighlight %}

We're now taking `% modulus` in a bunch of places, which is valid due to the above property and prevents the value of
both `result` and `base` from growing out of control.

That tops off our implementation of RSA. [Here's]({% static rsa.py %}) the entire source file.
